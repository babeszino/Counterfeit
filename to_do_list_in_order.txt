TO-DO:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-implement jumping between walls for the player - should have some good logic and a proper use

-add a wall jumping effect (simple grey smoke type of thing)

-add transition animations that plays when the player advances to the next level - these should give something to the story of the game

-add sound effects to the game

-add some cool stuff to the UI, like displaying the current weapon, showing an icon of the type of ammo it uses

-restructuring - maybe actually have a main scene that instances everything, instead of doing it all in code

-look at all the instancing in code - maybe all of it could be done in the editor instead?

-organize the project directory - including the assets, scenes and scripts - maybe upgrade the project to Godot 4.4?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
DONE:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-enemy patrol - finish it up

-check if I do anything at all with the "player" and the "enemy" scene groups - if not then remove

-do something about reuses of the "if enemy != null and player != null:" line in functionality.gd

-ammo and reloading

-make the viewport focus on the player (keep the player in the middle), zoom in closer to the player maybe?

-fix the bug where the player can shoot itself with the gun

-adding a menu where you can start the game, or quit

-draw a health bar which has 5 bars (80 hp should show only 4 bars, 20 hp should only show one) - match case in code

-add a UI to the game, which shows the player health bar and the ammo capacity/current bullets left in the magazine

-implement the randomized map order into the game

-add enemy spawn points

-implement the door opening, which enables the player to advance to the next level after finishing

-use groups whereever I can

-Player hp and ammo should reset to maximum when progressing to next level

-if enemies get shot, they should switch to ATTACK mode - they should also have a detection zone, which if the player shoots into, the enemy switches to ATTACK mode

-the enemy should not see through walls

-give the enemy a proper AI, so when it is in ATTACK mode, it chooses the shortest path to the player and stuff, doesn't get stuck in walls etc.

-add an enemy detection zone for the Player, so if the enemy AI turns to ATTACK mode, it should find the shortest path to the Player's detection zone, 
crouch down, shoot - if the Player moves and the Enemy is fully out of the Player's detection zone, then the Enemy should still stay in ATTACK mode and find the shortest path to
the Player's detection zone - repeat until either the Player dies or the Enemy dies

-fix enemies not colliding with each other

-add a death screen

-add pause screen - when pressing ESC, the screen should appear, and it should pause the game - should have 3 buttons: "Resume", "Return to main menu" and "Quit"

-redraw the healthbar because it looks kinda bad to be honest

-setup collision layers and mask properly everywhere, now it's all over the place (but works)

-setup z indexes properly in the editor instead (where it's in the code)

-delete useless imports from the assets directory

-draw all 5 map layouts - preferably ones that are bigger in height

-check all groups and if they are necessary/used at all

-use $ instead of get_node because it's so not organized rn

-restructure the whole project - scene-based architecture - it's too messy right now, the main scene and script is not even being used anymore - FinishDoor should be a separate scene for example

-redraw the main character and the enemy character - add animations!

-redraw the glock (currently named gun)

-draw the rest of the guns (baseball bat, double barrel shotgun, m4, rocket launcher)

-fix the death screen

-add the guns into the game - come up with a logic: how and where should the player get each weapon -> 5 map, 5 weapons, you get one weapon/map

-implement the knockback effect of the rocket launcher

-fix the enemy weapons dealing 25 damage (all of them for some reason)

-remove the "FiringAnimation" node from each weapon scene and every instance of it in scripts - not needed!

-player's and enemy's gun instance - replace with a weapon placeholder scene or just remove

-rename one of load_map or load_maps functions to something else in level_manager.gd - too similar

-use an easier way to calculate the player/enemy move animations (something instead of dot)

-add bleeding into the game when the player or an enemy gets shot

-add a crosshair that replaces the cursor

-implement the score system - double, triple, multi kill bonus + multiplier after finishing the level as fast as you can

-add a bar to the UI under the ammo display that shows the progress of the reloading

-save the ScoreContainer from UI.tscn as a separate scene maybe

-take a look at rocket.gd - is the set_shooter function even needed? only the player can be the shooter

-fix the reload progress bar changing sizes
