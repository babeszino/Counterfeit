PART 9 - 6:58

TO-DO:

-enemy patrol - finish it up from the video

-give the enemy a proper AI, so when it is in ATTACK mode, it chooses the shortest path to the player and stuff, doesn't get stuck in walls etc.

-ammo and reloading

-make the viewport focus on the player (keep the player in the middle), zoom in closer to the player maybe?

-adding a menu where you can start the game, or quit

-draw a health bar which has 5 bars (80 hp should show only 4 bars, 20 hp should only show one) - match case in code

-draw all 5 map layouts - preferably bigger ones

-implement the randomized map order into the game

-implement the door opening, which enables the player to advance to the next level after finishing

-implement transition animations that plays when the player advances to the next level - these should give something to the story of the game

-draw the rest of the guns (baseball bat, double barrel shotgun, m4, rocket launcher)

-implement the guns into the game - come up with a logic: how and where should the player get each weapon -> 5 map, 5 weapons, you get one weapon/map

-implement the knockback effect of the rocket launcher

-implement the score system - double, triple, multi kill bonus + multiplier after finishing the level as fast as you can

-implement jumping between walls for the player - should have some good logic and a proper use

-add a UI to the game, which shows the player health bar and the ammo capacity/current bullets left in the magazine

-add some cool stuff to the UI, like displaying the current weapon, showing an icon of the type of ammo it uses
