TO-DO:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-setup collision layers and mask properly everywhere, now it's all over the place (but works)

-draw all 5 map layouts - preferably ones that are bigger in height

-restructure the whole project - scene-based architecture - it's too messy right now, the main scene and script is not even being used anymore

-add transition animations that plays when the player advances to the next level - these should give something to the story of the game

-redraw the glock (currently named gun)

-draw the rest of the guns (baseball bat, double barrel shotgun, m4, rocket launcher)

-add the guns into the game - come up with a logic: how and where should the player get each weapon -> 5 map, 5 weapons, you get one weapon/map

-implement the knockback effect of the rocket launcher

-implement the score system - double, triple, multi kill bonus + multiplier after finishing the level as fast as you can

-implement jumping between walls for the player - should have some good logic and a proper use

-add some cool stuff to the UI, like displaying the current weapon, showing an icon of the type of ammo it uses

-add health bar to enemy players because why not

-don't shoot the whole cartridge - add animation to the bullet maybe (cartridge falling off to the side)?

-organize the project directory - including the assets, scenes and scripts - maybe upgrade the project to Godot 4.4?

DONE:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-enemy patrol - finish it up

-check if I do anything at all with the "player" and the "enemy" scene groups - if not then remove

-do something about reuses of the "if enemy != null and player != null:" line in functionality.gd

-ammo and reloading

-make the viewport focus on the player (keep the player in the middle), zoom in closer to the player maybe?

-fix the bug where the player can shoot itself with the gun

-adding a menu where you can start the game, or quit

-draw a health bar which has 5 bars (80 hp should show only 4 bars, 20 hp should only show one) - match case in code

-add a UI to the game, which shows the player health bar and the ammo capacity/current bullets left in the magazine

-implement the randomized map order into the game

-add enemy spawn points

-implement the door opening, which enables the player to advance to the next level after finishing

-use groups whereever I can

-Player hp and ammo should reset to maximum when progressing to next level

-if enemies get shot, they should switch to ATTACK mode - they should also have a detection zone, which if the player shoots into, the enemy switches to ATTACK mode

-the enemy should not see through walls

-give the enemy a proper AI, so when it is in ATTACK mode, it chooses the shortest path to the player and stuff, doesn't get stuck in walls etc.

-add an enemy detection zone for the Player, so if the enemy AI turns to ATTACK mode, it should find the shortest path to the Player's detection zone, 
crouch down, shoot - if the Player moves and the Enemy is fully out of the Player's detection zone, then the Enemy should still stay in ATTACK mode and find the shortest path to
the Player's detection zone - repeat until either the Player dies or the Enemy dies

-fix enemies not colliding with each other

-add a death screen

-add pause screen - when pressing ESC, the screen should appear, and it should pause the game - should have 3 buttons: "Resume", "Return to main menu" and "Quit"

-redraw the healthbar because it looks kinda bad to be honest
